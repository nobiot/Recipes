# Open Sauce Recipes

Open Sauce Recipes of Plain Good Food, Written in Plain Text

It is our log of culinary experiments. Some quick, easy and
useful. Some funny.

## Aspiration and TODOs
- Want to make it more fun and vibrant with css style with emoji and
icons (like icons for vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian etc.)
- Useful log and recipe book with lots of good photos

## Style Guide (WIP)
- One dish, one `.md` file
- Images -- 4:3 aspect ratio (e.g. 640Ã—427)
