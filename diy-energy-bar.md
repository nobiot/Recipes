# DIY Energy Bars

Sauce of this recipe can be found: http://www.nutritionistinthekitch.com/apricot-cashew-energy-bars/ .

Consider the quantity of ingredients is a ratio.
I use the imperial pint measuring jar, and given the size of the
baking tray available to me, I use one half of the value of the
measurement in this recipe, in a pint jar.

I also add cacao nibs from the local supermarket (Sainsbury's).
Great addition. Perhaps I could add sesami seeds as well.

## Version 1
- I didn't have agave syrup, so used honey instead
- And... I forgot to put in oats (!). But in the end, the energy bar
came up really nice
- Didn't have hemp seeds, so used poppy seeds instead
